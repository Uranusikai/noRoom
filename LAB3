/*



This program is a solution to Lab 3 -- 



	Pushbutton switches are connected to Pins PD2(pulled high when switch is open).



	LEDs are connected to Pins PC0 PC1 PC2 PC3 (active low). 



	



	The program causes  rotate a single lighted LED through the row of four LEDs and then repeat the pattern indefinitely.

	If the switch is pressed, pause the cycling pattern and turn on all LEDs until the switch is released.
